# Path Continuity (Stateful Phase-Lift)

**ID:** `core-path-continuity`  
**Tier:** core  
**Score:** 66  
**Units:** OK  
**Theory:** PASS  

## Equation

$$
\theta_{R,k}=\mathrm{unwrap}(\arg z_k;\,\theta_{R,k-1})
$$

## Description

Turns phase into a continuous real trajectory by chaining the unwrap rule sample-to-sample (except at true singularities like z=0).
